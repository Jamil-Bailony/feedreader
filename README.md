# Arcade Game Project
This is my forth project at Udacity. In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I come in. Therefore, I had to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These tests will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
